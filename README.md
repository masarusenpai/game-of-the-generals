# game-of-the-generals
A singleplayer recreation of Game of the Generals (pretty much Filipino chess) coded in Python.

## IMPORTANT: [`termcolor`](https://github.com/termcolor/termcolor)!

This program uses the `termcolor` module to display coloured and formatted text, so please ensure it's installed before running.

```bash
# MacOS/Windows
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade termcolor

# Linux
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install termcolor
```

Alternatively, you may also follow the source installation directions on GitHub (if you're into that).
