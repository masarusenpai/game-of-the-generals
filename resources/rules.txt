SUMMARY
You are given 21 pieces representing different
combatants in an army, including one representing
a FLAG. The main objective of the game is
essentially to eliminate your opponent's flag by
maneuvering your pieces across the board towards
it.

SETUP AND RANKING
The game is played on a 9Ã—8 board. The layout of
your 21 pieces may be arranged however you like,
as long as they are within the nearest 3 rows of
the board. Alternatively, you have the option to
randomise the positions of the pieces.

All 21 pieces are arranged into different ranks.
The main idea is that any higher-ranking piece may
eliminate a lower-ranking piece. If both pieces
are of the same rank, both are eliminated. Note
that there are a few exceptions to these rules.
Below is a table listing all pieces arranged from
lowest to highest rank, as well as some additional
notes/exceptions.

GAMEPLAY
You are allowed to move your own pieces in the
following unit directions (meaning one square
every turn): up, down, left and right (assuming
you are not blocked by another friendly piece or
the move does not take you out of bounds). The
identities of the opposing pieces are hidden,
essentially simulating the fog of war. Pieces may
challenge opposing pieces by (legally) occupying
the position of the opponent, to which the ranking
hierarchy applies.

To win the game, you must either
- capture the opponent's flag with any of your
  pieces (including your flag) or
- maneuver your flag to the very end of the board.
  At this point, if there are no adjacent pieces
  to your flag, you immediately win. Otherwise,
  all of the adjacent pieces will have to fail to
  immediately challenge/eliminate your flag in the
  next turn for you to win.

Feel free to apply your own strategies in playing
this game! I can't give any sound advice in this
area, sadly. I happen to be better at coding than
warfare. ðŸ˜­
